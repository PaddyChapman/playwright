# These are very basic playwright tests, config has been edited to run in headed mode and the example spec tests are skipped.
# The writer.spec.ts file contains UI tests to check pages load correctly on the writer website. It also contains an API test to make sure authorization on the permissions end-point works as exptected.

# To run the tests
1. Execute command 'npx playwright test' 

# Any questions don't hesitate to reach out :)
